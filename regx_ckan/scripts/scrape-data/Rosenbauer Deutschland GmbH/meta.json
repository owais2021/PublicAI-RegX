The fire services are supported via the Rosenbauer Deutschland sales and service company, which has its headquarters in Luckenwalde near Berlin. Other centers are located in Karlsruhe and Viersen.",
                "Support is further intensified through cooperation with 18 independent sales and service partners throughout the country. These partners ensure that the German fire services receive full coverage support. Moreover, the Rosenbauer service centers in Luckenwalde, Karlsruhe and Viersen have a network of mobile service engineers at their disposal.",
                "Rosenbauer has been active in Germany with its own subsidiary since the 1970s and 1998 and the takeover of the Luckenwalde Works, where the standard fire trucks for the German market are currently manufactured. In Germany, Rosenbauer sells a complete program of DIN and industrial vehicles, ARFFs, fire fighting equipment and stationary extinguishing systems. Apart from the fire services, customers include numerous other emergency organizations, such as the Technische Hilfswerk, the rescue services and the federal police.",
