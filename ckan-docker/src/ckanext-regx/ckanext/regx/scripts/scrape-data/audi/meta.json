                "What are the types of EVs?",
                "Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV or EV): A vehicle that uses electric motors as its only source of power. It stores energy in a battery and gets recharged using an electrical outlet at home or by plugging into a public charging station. BEVs (or EVs) rely exclusively on the battery and electric motors to operate.",
                "Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV): A vehicle that uses both a battery and electric motor, as well as a traditional gasoline engine. If the vehicleâs battery runs low, the engine automatically turns on to continue driving. The vehicleâs battery can be charged using an electrical outlet, charging station or, in certain situations, is recharged using the vehicleâs engine.",
                "Mild hybrid: A vehicle that runs solely using engine power but has the ability to save energy by turning off the engine when the vehicle is stopped and, in turn, using the stored energy to power auxiliary features. Mild hybrids do not plug in.",
                "What is regenerative braking?",
                "When you apply the brakes, energy is created and converted  to electric energy which is sent to the vehicleâs battery. While you wonât fully charge your e-tron by braking, regenerative braking will add some power to your battery while helping extend range.",
                "What is one-pedal driving?",
                "One-pedal driving is using motor regeneration to slow the vehicle down, rather than a brake pedal. The brake pedal must still be used, but in many situations speed can be modulated by just using the accelerator pedal. Using the paddles on the steering wheel, the amount of âengine brakingâ can be adjusted. On the highest setting, the vehicle slows quite significantly when the throttle/accelerator pedal isnât pushed. This allows you to accelerate and slow the vehicle simply based on using one foot on the accelerator pedal. When the electric motor is slowing the vehicle, it is also charging the battery, which can help increase range.",
                "How else are Audi e-tron EVs sustainable?",
                "Obviously, being a battery-operated electric vehicle, the e-tron is helping reduce emissions by not burning gasoline while driving, but there are quite a few other ways that Audi and e-tron vehicles are helping to be more ecologically friendly. The production facility in Brussels, Belgium where e-tron model range is produced has been certified as net carbon-neutral since 2018.*",
                "*Certification provided by VinÃ§otte.  Based on partial reduction of emissions through use of renewable energy, in addition to purchased carbon offsets.",

                "The range of an EV, similar to that of a combustion engine, relies on a number of factors such as driving behavior, accessories used, temperature, terrain, driving route, and charging frequency. However, in order to help provide you with peace of mind for your journey, Audi e-tron EVs come equipped with the Audi Route planner, which shows you not only the charging stations along your route, but also estimates how many charges you will need to reach your destination.",
                "What if I need to take a long road trip?",
                "Road trips are top of mind for EV owners, and, in reality, they are very similar to taking a trip in your current gas vehicle. Usually, drivers stop every couple of hours to stretch their legs, use the bathroom, eat, or get fuel. For instance, you can charge from 5%â80% in as little as 22.5 minutes* in a 2023 Audi e-tron GT when using a public high-speed charging unit capable of charging at 270 kW, youâre able to easily recharge during one of your normal road trip pit stops. The e-tron Route planner and other apps will help you create a route with plenty of high-speed charging options.",

                "Is range a sole factor in choosing electric?",
                "Audi has spent extensive time on research and development, as well as testing our e-tron models, to ensure they meet the high quality standards synonymous with all of our vehicles. Significant time and effort has gone into the technology behind the e-tron battery and charging systems. Our focus is creating a reliable, long-lasting EV that is an Audi through-and-through, and range is one factor. Consider, on average, how much you drive each day and this can help determine how range plays a role. On average, 98% of all single-trip journeys in the U.S. are under 50 mi and premium vehicle owners average only 30 mi/day.* So while many people focus on the longest range, it doesnât really affect daily drivingâespecially since you can fully charge at home every night.",

                "Just like stopping to refuel your current vehicle for road trips, charging frequency will depend on how far you travel. Similar to what would affect your gas vehicle, there are other variables that affect how frequently you will need to stop and charge, including: air-conditioning usage, speed, acceleration, temperature, and load weight (passengers and luggage in the vehicle). The Audi route planner can help you determine the number of stops youâll need to make based on your trip, and will help pre-determine the most ideal charging locations to stop. Charging times will vary based on the amount of charge remaining in your e-tron, the amount you want to charge, as well as the speed of the charging unit you use.",
                "Where are charging locations near me?",
                "To locate charging stations along your journey or near your home, use your myAudi app or the MMI navigation on your e-tron. Your e-tron will also automatically indicate nearby chargers and suggest a charging unit when your battery level reaches a certain level. You may also use third-party apps such as PlugShare to locate charging stations.",
                "Can I charge at other charging stations (non-Audi)?",
                "Other electric vehicle manufacturers may have a proprietary charging network which prevents other brands from using their charging units. The Audi e-tron models utilize a CCS (combined charging system) style charger, which is the most prevalent nationwide. You can use the myAudi app to locate charging units that are compatible with your Audi e-tron, which are compliant with SAE J1772 standards.",

                "Do extreme temperatures affect the battery?",
                "It depends. In order to reduce the impact of extreme heat or cold temperatures on the battery, Audi recommends using the preconditioning feature while plugged in, allowing battery energy to be focused on driving rather than heating or cooling.",
                "How does charging affect the battery?",
                "Using a public charging unit of any speed wonât have a negative effect on your battery. The biggest thing to keep in mind to help prolong the life and health of your battery is how often you charge to 100%. All batteries actually benefit when they arenât constantly charged completely. While obviously, the range of your e-tron is at its maximum when the battery is charged completely, for most instances, you wonât need a full charge. Itâs recommended to charge to 80% on most occasions when you donât need the extra distance that comes along with a full charge. This is true when charging both at home and at public chargers.",

                "What are the types of EVs?",
                "Battery Electric Vehicle (BEV or EV): A vehicle that uses electric motors as its only source of power. It stores energy in a battery and gets recharged using an electrical outlet at home or by plugging into a public charging station. BEVs (or EVs) rely exclusively on the battery and electric motors to operate.",
                "Plug-in Hybrid Electric Vehicle (PHEV): A vehicle that uses both a battery and electric motor, as well as a traditional gasoline engine. If the vehicleâs battery runs low, the engine automatically turns on to continue driving. The vehicleâs battery can be charged using an electrical outlet, charging station or, in certain situations, is recharged using the vehicleâs engine.",
                "Mild hybrid: A vehicle that runs solely using engine power but has the ability to save energy by turning off the engine when the vehicle is stopped and, in turn, using the stored energy to power auxiliary features. Mild hybrids do not plug in.",
                "What is regenerative braking?",
                "When you apply the brakes, energy is created and converted  to electric energy which is sent to the vehicleâs battery. While you wonât fully charge your e-tron by braking, regenerative braking will add some power to your battery while helping extend range.",
                "What is one-pedal driving?",
                "One-pedal driving is using motor regeneration to slow the vehicle down, rather than a brake pedal. The brake pedal must still be used, but in many situations speed can be modulated by just using the accelerator pedal. Using the paddles on the steering wheel, the amount of âengine brakingâ can be adjusted. On the highest setting, the vehicle slows quite significantly when the throttle/accelerator pedal isnât pushed. This allows you to accelerate and slow the vehicle simply based on using one foot on the accelerator pedal. When the electric motor is slowing the vehicle, it is also charging the battery, which can help increase range.",
                "How else are Audi e-tron EVs sustainable?",
                "Obviously, being a battery-operated electric vehicle, the e-tron is helping reduce emissions by not burning gasoline while driving, but there are quite a few other ways that Audi and e-tron vehicles are helping to be more ecologically friendly. The production facility in Brussels, Belgium where e-tron model range is produced has been certified as net carbon-neutral since 2018.*",
                "*Certification provided by VinÃ§otte.  Based on partial reduction of emissions through use of renewable energy, in addition to purchased carbon offsets.",

                "Is range a sole factor in choosing electric?",
                "Audi has spent extensive time on research and development, as well as testing our e-tron models, to ensure they meet the high quality standards synonymous with all of our vehicles. Significant time and effort has gone into the technology behind the e-tron battery and charging systems. Our focus is creating a reliable, long-lasting EV that is an Audi through-and-through, and range is one factor. Consider, on average, how much you drive each day and this can help determine how range plays a role. On average, 98% of all single-trip journeys in the U.S. are under 50 mi and premium vehicle owners average only 30 mi/day.* So while many people focus on the longest range, it doesnât really affect daily drivingâespecially since you can fully charge at home every night.",

                "Audi e-tron EVs include a limited warranty* on the battery for 8 years/100,000 miles (whichever occurs first). Audi has designed a battery with independent cells that can be replaced by an Audi certified EV technician, which may prevent the need to replace the entire battery if any repairs are needed.",

Warranty coverage may not return battery capacity to an âas newâ condition with 100% net capacity. See ownerâs literature or dealer for limited warranty details.",
                "Do extreme temperatures affect the battery?",
                "It depends. In order to reduce the impact of extreme heat or cold temperatures on the battery, Audi recommends using the preconditioning feature while plugged in, allowing battery energy to be focused on driving rather than heating or cooling.",
                "How does charging affect the battery?",
                "Using a public charging unit of any speed wonât have a negative effect on your battery. The biggest thing to keep in mind to help prolong the life and health of your battery is how often you charge to 100%. All batteries actually benefit when they arenât constantly charged completely. While obviously, the range of your e-tron is at its maximum when the battery is charged completely, for most instances, you wonât need a full charge. Itâs recommended to charge to 80% on most occasions when you donât need the extra distance that comes along with a full charge. This is true when charging both at home and at public chargers.",
