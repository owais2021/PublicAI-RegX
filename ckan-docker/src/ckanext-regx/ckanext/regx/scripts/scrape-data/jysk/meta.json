For many years, we have diligently focused on increasing the quality of our products throughout our assortment and we will build on this foundation when we continue to deliver Trusted Quality Products.",

                "Quality and Tests",

                "We are committed to ensuring that selected of the largest material groups used in our products are certified according to relevant standards, and we are working towards applying these certifications to all applicable products across our assortment, wherever the selected materials are used.",
                "Through ongoing research and testing, we are actively investigating new opportunities for responsible initiatives at the product level and remain committed to continuing this work. These initiatives include new certifications, lower-emission material options, and using recycled materials. Many of the basic materials used in our products are recycled as standard. This includes a large share of aluminium, steel, iron, and glass (including foam), all recycled without notice.",
                "Moving forward we will continue setting ambitious targets, as we have already done with certifications such as FSC®, OEKO-TEX®, and Better Cotton, with which we continue to work closely.",
                "Certifications JYSK Is Working With",
                "At JYSK, we are working with certifications at the product level. You can read more about our partnerships with these organisations and how we work with the certificates below.",
                "Forest Stewardship Council®",
                "OEKO-TEX® STANDARD 100",
                "OEKO-TEX® MADE IN GREEN",
                "Better Cotton Membership",
                "Global Recycled Standard",
                "Forest Stewardship Council®",
                "Forest Stewardship Council® (FSC®) is a non-profit organization and labelling scheme on a mission to ensure healthy, resilient forests around the world. For more than 30 years the FSC-label has ensured that the wood, paper, and other forest-based material used within a product is sourced from responsibly managed forests that preservers biological diversity, protects endangered species, and benefits the lives of local people and worker’s rights and safety.",
                "As the only scheme of its kind, FSC give democratic and equal influence and voting power between businesses, environmental NGOs, and social NGOs. The FSC certification scheme is trusted worldwide by businesses and consumers and recommended by leading environmental organisations like the WWF.  Furthermore, FSC is working with indigenous Peoples to collectively find solutions to environmental and social challenges in the world's forests.",
                "JYSK has been a member of FSC Denmark since 2006 and is also a member of FSC Germany. Since January 2025, all newly sourced products and packaging made from wood, cardboard, or paper are FSC certified (FSC® N001715) as well as already existing products and packaging have been since 2023.",
                "We also promote responsible forestry through initiatives like the FSC week, an annual event held in the Nordic countries.",
                "OEKO-TEX® STANDARD 100",
                "OEKO-TEX® is a label for textiles tested for harmful substances and sets the standard for textile safety, from yarn to finished product. OEKO-TEX® STANDARD 100 is an assurance for both JYSK and our customers that products bearing the label are certified to have passed safety tests for the presence of harmful substances, making them harmless to human health. Products with this label have been tested for more than 1000 potentially harmful substances.",
                "The majority of JYSK's textile products are certified according to this standard. Specifically, it applies to all items where at least 80% of the weight consists of textile materials. OEKO-TEX® STANDARD 100 label is also found on other products, such as the main components of our duvets and pillows. JYSK is certified under OEKO-TEX (976-14601).",
                "When a product displays the OEKO-TEX® STANDARD 100 label, it indicates that the entire item, including non-textile components like zippers, buttons, and accessories, has been tested for harmful chemicals by independent OEKO-TEX® partner institutions.",
                "OEKO-TEX® MADE IN GREEN",
                "OEKO-TEX® MADE IN GREEN is an extension of OEKO-TEX® STANDARD 100. In addition to ensuring that products do not contain harmful levels of problematic chemicals, OEKO-TEX® MADE IN GREEN also ensures that products are produced more sustainably in socially responsible workplaces. Workers are afforded fair wages, regular working hours, and safe working conditions. Furthermore, the certificate promotes environmental responsibility by focusing on chemical management and wastewater quality. You can find the OEKO-TEX® MADE IN GREEN label on selected products within our assortment.",
                "Better Cotton Membership",
                "JYSK is a proud member of Better Cotton, the world’s leading initiative for sustainable cotton production. Better Cotton has trained over two million farmers across 22 countries to adopt more environmentally responsible practices, including reducing water and pesticide use while improving cotton yields.",
                "Although cotton is a natural and renewable material, conventional cotton production poses significant environmental challenges due to the extensive use of pesticides, chemical fertilisers, and water. Fortunately, more sustainable methods of cotton production are available.",
                "The goal of Better Cotton is to transform cotton production on a global scale, ensuring that, in the long term, all cotton is produced more sustainably. Through this initiative, Better Cotton aims to set a new standard for the entire industry regarding cotton as a material.",
                "Cotton sourced as Better Cotton is not physically traceable from field to end product because segregating cotton throughout the supply chain is complex and costly. To address this, Better Cotton employs a mass-balance system, which allows for a simpler, more cost-effective approach. This system ensures that the amount of cotton sourced as Better Cotton matches the volume produced by Better Cotton farmers, helping to increase demand and expand the global supply of more sustainable cotton.",
                "At JYSK, we are committed to contributing to and promoting more responsible cotton production. Therefore, since January 2025, 100% of our cotton for all newly sourced textile products are sourced as more sustainable cotton. By more sustainable, we refer to either organic cotton, recycled cotton, or Better Cotton.",
                "Textile products represent a significant portion of our assortment, covering all items where textiles comprise at least 80% of the product's weight, such as duvet cover sets and towels.",
                "We have passed the Better Cotton Chain of Custody training and have access to the Better Cotton Platform. Our Better Cotton Platform number is 1006670-1.",
                "Global Recycled Standard",
                "The Global Recycled Standard (GRS) is an international, voluntary standard that verifies recycled materials and tracks them from the recycler to the final product. Products certified to the Global Recycled Standard contain recycled material that has been independently verified at each stage of the supply chain. In addition, facilities from the recycler to final supplier have met social, environmental, and chemical requirements.",
                "JYSK is certified under the Global Recycled Standard (CU-1050252). At JYSK we specifically work with recycled fibers in our textile products and we use the GRS certification to ensure that fibers applied have actually been recycled.",
                "The number of products made fully or partially from recycled materials is continually increasing, and we plan to continue introducing even more products made from recycled content in the future as part of our ongoing sustainability efforts.",
                "Other Product-Specific Initiatives",
                "In addition to our ongoing work with certified materials, we are dedicated to implementing other product-specific initiatives that address broader environmental and ethical concerns. These efforts include optimising packaging solutions, reducing plastics usage, and promoting animal welfare.",
                "Packaging",
                "Packaging is a crucial aspect of our products. While we have made significant progress, we remain committed to further reducing the materials used for packaging. Our ongoing improvements have not only decreased the overall amount of packaging, including plastic, but have also optimised space in shipping containers.",
                "We continuously update our packaging materials and designs, incorporating more responsible options across our product range. For several items, we have transitioned from plastic packaging to FSC®-certified cardboard belly bands, aligning with our goal to minimise plastic consumption (FSC® N001715). We are constantly exploring ways to eliminate unnecessary plastic and excess materials from our packaging without compromising the practicality or protective function of the packaging.",
                "Animal Welfare",
                "At JYSK, we are committed to upholding high animal welfare standards and do not tolerate animal cruelty. Our Supplier Code of Conduct, which applies to our product suppliers, outlines specific requirements related to animal welfare.",
                "Duvets and pillows are core products for us, many of which contain down and feathers. A significant concern in this context is the practice of plucking down from live birds, which is considered cruel and is illegal in Europe and many other countries. JYSK strictly prohibits the use of down and feathers sourced from live birds.",
                "To ensure compliance, we conduct checks of our supply chain in collaboration with the International Down and Feather Laboratory (IDFL), which inspects the entire supply chain, including farms and abattoirs. We source down and feathers exclusively as byproducts of the food industry, which means our product suppliers are contractually obliged to provide only materials from birds that have been slaughtered. Consequently, the down and feathers in our products come from birds that were destined for slaughter and are harvested post-mortem.",
                "Additionally, JYSK offers a limited selection of animal skins and products containing wool. All animal skins sold at JYSK come from slaughtered animals, meaning the animals were not raised or killed solely for their skins. We also categorically reject the practice of mulesing in sheep, as explicitly stated in our Supplier Code of Conduct, which all product suppliers must adhere to.",
                "Product Footprint",
                "At JYSK, we recognise the importance of considering a product's entire lifecycle, including its durability, disassembly, discarding, component recycling, and end-of-life options.",
                "Some of these aspects are ongoing efforts for us. For many years, we have been focused on improving the durability of our products through a robust quality testing setup and continuous data evaluation. By prioritising durable products, we can improve their longevity and resilience, helping to reduce the need for frequent replacements.",
                "We also assist customers in extending the life of their JYSK products by providing maintenance guidance for the products as well as having more than 4000 spare parts available for selected products free of charge.",
                "Moving forward, we will increase our focus on integrating end-of-life considerations into the design phase, as this is crucial for reducing emissions. The design stage significantly impacts a product's lifecycle emissions, so we strive to allow these considerations to guide our design processes, ultimately aiming to reduce our overall product footprint going forward.",
                "Calculating Product Footprint",
                "An important step in our sustainability efforts is calculating the product footprint of our items. This involves assessing the total climate impact emitted throughout a product's lifecycle. We make calculations based on data from different databases and adhere to the European guidelines to perform these calculations.",
                "JYSK has initiated the work of calculating the product footprint for selected items across various categories, estimating their CO2e emissions. However, we do not yet have this data for all products, which remains our goal. To achieve this, we are currently working on gathering the necessary data that will allow us to calculate the footprint for all our products. This is a time-consuming task, as we need comprehensive data from all suppliers. These data include, among other factors:",
                "• Materials used",
                "• Weight of each material",
                "• Country of origin for materials",
                "• Country of origin for production",
                "• Production processes",
                "In the long term, we aim to develop an internal scoring system for our products from a sustainability perspective. By leveraging various data insights, we will gain a clearer understanding of which of our products have the most significant environmental impact.

We work with amfori BSCI to monitor manufacturers in risk countries and with amfori BEPI monitoring across all countries. The monitoring is divided into different thematic areas, rated from 'A' to 'E' based on how well the manufacturer meets the criteria. These ratings are then combined into an overall monitoring score.",
                "The amfori Quality Management Initiative (QMI) provides a set of standardised tools that enable manufacturers to drive quality management and capability improvements in their supply chain and production. At JYSK, we aim to use QMI to gain a better understanding of the quality management levels in specific factories and how they implement continuous improvements in their internal quality control.",

This includes so-called risk countries, which are defined as countries where there is a greater risk of non-compliance with the fundamental rights at work outlined in the International Labour Organisation’s (ILO) Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.",
                "As a member of amfori BSCI, JYSK adheres to a common Code of Conduct – a set of rules that outlines specific requirements regarding the conditions in the factories where JYSK products are manufactured. The amfori BSCI Code of Conduct references international conventions such as the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the UN Guiding Principles for Business and Human Rights, the OECD Guidelines, and the ILO's Declaration on Fundamental Principles and Rights at Work.",
                "The amfori BSCI Code of Conduct consists of 13 principles that promote ethical and socially responsible business practices. These principles address issues such as the prohibition of child labour, forced labour, discrimination, and corruption. The Code also includes requirements for workplace safety, reasonable working hours, and the right of factory employees to join a union and engage in collective bargaining. All manufacturers in risk countries must accept and comply with our Supplier Code of Conduct, which incorporates the 13 principles of the amfori BSCI Code.",
                "Audit Setup for amfori BSCI",
                "Before JYSK begins collaborating with a new manufacturer, an assessment of the working conditions at the production site is mandatory. Every production site located in a risk country must provide a valid third-party audit report. The audit must be completed before JYSK will start any collaboration with the site, and regular audits are conducted thereafter. The frequency of these audits depends on the findings of the previous audit.",
                "amfori BSCI is responsible for carrying out the audits, which are conducted by impartial third-party auditors. To ensure an accurate evaluation of the production site, JYSK mandates semi-announced audits, meaning the production site is informed only of a one-month time window in which the audit will take place – but not the exact date. This ensures that the site remains prepared for inspection at any time within that period.",
                "To further ensure reliable results, employees are randomly selected for qualitative interviews, conducted in a separate location to ensure their anonymity and comfort. Multiple employees are interviewed to provide a comprehensive view of the working conditions, and this approach helps employees feel safe to speak openly and honestly about their workplace environment.",
                "If the audit reveals any non-compliance with the Code of Conduct, the manufacturer is required to create an action plan and begin improvements immediately. A follow-up audit will be scheduled to verify that the necessary changes have been made. In cases of serious breaches, a zero-tolerance protocol is triggered. Immediate action is required to address the violation, and a remediation group is formed to create a plan for corrective measures. This group also determines appropriate remediation for the affected individuals. In such cases, the Compliance & Quality Director of JYSK is involved immediately, and the Executive Vice President of Purchasing is informed.",
                "The day-to-day responsibility of overseeing manufacturers’ compliance with the Code of Conduct, including the protection of workers’ human rights, is based in the JYSK Compliance & Quality department, where a BSCI-responsible is appointed.",
                "Dialogue and Involvement Are the Way Forward",
                "When deviations from our Supplier Code of Conduct are identified at a factory, JYSK prefers to continue working with the manufacturer to ensure improvements are made. Simply ending the cooperation and turning our backs on the problems would mean that change never happens. Continuous improvement is at the heart of amfori BSCI, and at JYSK, we believe that dialogue and involvement are key to improving social conditions.",
                "However, for future cooperation to continue, we must see measurable improvements at the factory. If progress is not made, the partnership will be terminated.",

                "Risk assessments are a core component of the amfori BEPI system. These assessments are self-declared by suppliers and can cover up to eight key environmental performance areas. In their assessments, suppliers must provide data on factors such as energy and water consumption, waste generation, and the presence of environmental management systems, among others.",
                "The implementation of BEPI environmental monitoring for manufacturers is ongoing, encompassing all eight key environmental performance areas.",
                "During monitoring, third-party monitoring partners verify the data provided in the risk assessments. As this involves reviewing substantial documentation, such as energy bills, water usage records, and waste production reports, BEPI monitoring is fully announced to allow manufacturers time to prepare the required information. These audits provide JYSK with relevant data on key environmental metrics from our manufacturers.",

This tool evaluates suppliers based on a range of criteria, including key aspects such as order handling, claims rate, and other relevant KPIs, alongside their amfori BSCI scores. The SPM is regularly updated to include new and relevant factors.",

Moving forward, we aim to give sustainability parameters even greater weight in supplier evaluations. Additionally, we continuously set clear performance expectations and audit benchmarks that our product suppliers must meet in their audits.",

                "Although JYSKs GHG emissions from own operations are less than 2% of the company’s total emissions, JYSK will also work to reduce our footprint here. One way to reach this goal is through renewable energy solutions, such as installing solar panels on the roofs of our distribution centres. This initiative has already shown positive results in multiple countries, with solar panels now accounting for up to 30% of the energy used in these centres. Additionally, we will be looking into efficient methods to lower our emissions from powering, heating, and cooling of our stores, distribution centres, and offices.",
                "For our Scope 3 initiatives, in the near-term we are placing a strong focus on supplier engagement with the production of our products being the largest source of emissions. JYSK will require our suppliers, covering 72,5% of the emissions from purchased goods and services, to calculate their emissions and set science-based targets before the end of the financial year 2028.",
                "Moving forward, JYSK will support our suppliers in initiating their work on climate accounting so that together we can deliver on our commitment to reduce our climate footprint.",
                "Other key initiatives within Scope 3 include exploring lower-emission materials by calculating the product footprint of our products. Additionally, we are focusing on load and route optimisation in our upstream transportation, as well as shifting the mode of transportation towards less-emitting solutions.",

Targets are considered science-based if they are consistent with the goals of the Paris Agreement, which aims to limit global warming to well below 2°C above pre-industrial levels and pursue efforts to restrict it to 1.5°C.",
                "SBTi focuses on emissions across three categories: Scope 1, 2, and 3. These scopes classify greenhouse gas emissions generated by JYSK directly (Scope 1), indirectly through energy consumption (Scope 2), and through our supply chain and customer activities (Scope 3).

Because of this, we are often more easily able to monitor and reduce emissions within this scope.",

This includes emissions from generating electricity, heating, or cooling that we use in our operations. These emissions are a consequence of JYSK’s energy demand. We can more easily track these emissions as they can be calculated based on invoices received from our energy suppliers.",
